# Python to C++ Translator using Frontier Model

This project enables automatic translation of Python code into high-performance C++ using an open-source Frontier language model. It combines the power of AI with intuitive user experience through a Gradio-based web interface, making it a practical tool for developers aiming to optimize Python applications.

## Features

+ AI-Powered Code Translation: Converts Python scripts into efficient C++ code using a language model hosted on HuggingFace.

+ Gradio Web Interface: Offers a simple, interactive UI for users to input Python code and receive translated C++ output.

+ API Deployment: Demonstrates how to host open-source models behind an API for scalable production use.

+ Performance-Focused Output: Generates clean, optimized C++ code suitable for performance-critical applications.

## Technologies Used

+ Frontier Model (Open Source): For Python-to-C++ translation.

+ HuggingFace: Hosting the model endpoint for API access.

+ Gradio: Building the user-friendly interface.

+ Python: Backend logic and integration.

+ Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective instructions for the model to ensure high-quality code translation.

## Usage

+ Enter your Python code in the input box.

+ Click “Translate”.

+ The tool will send your code to the Frontier model via the API and return the equivalent C++ code in seconds.
